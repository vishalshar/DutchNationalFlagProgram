DutchNationalFlagProgram
========================
The Dutch national flag problem is a computer science programming problem proposed by Edsger Dijkstra. The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colours: red, white and blue. Given balls of these three colours arranged randomly in a line (the actual number of balls does not matter), the task is to arrange them such that all balls of the same colour are together and their collective colour groups are in the correct order.
